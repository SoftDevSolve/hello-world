My ideas to transform rural areas  through Coding
Rural areas have higher rate of poverty.
Alot of youth are prone to poverty and this limits their abilities to advance their lives and careers.
In order to empower youth to gain new skills and knowledge, an open source platform should be created in the local language.
Alot of the school curriculum in my country is outdated and does not withstand the test of the modern times to prepare students for the upcoming challenges.
Soft skills are as important in preparing the high school students from rural areas to what is to come, what to look out for, what to study and what career options and opportunities they have.
Alot of rural schools do not have extracuricular activities. Yet, alot of parents complain that youth spend too much time on the phone browsing the internet and social media. This could be harnessed through developing an interactive platform, where youth can search for the right information to empower themselves to do better things or learn new skills or join virtual clubs or hobbies.
